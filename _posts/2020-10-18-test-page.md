A new page is opened. It is test page and I try to write several examples, like:

```python
import numpy as np

def test_function(arr):
    min = np.min(arr)
    max = np.max(arr)
    return max - min

if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
    print(f'The value of max - min is {test_function(arr)}')

```
